### üõ†Ô∏è Projects

#### Water Potability Prediction: 
Developed a machine learning model to predict water potability using key water quality parameters (e.g., pH, hardness, turbidity).
The model will classify water as potable or non-potable, offering a fast, reliable tool for assessing drinking water safety.

#### Drug Consumption Prediction: 
Developed a machine learning model to predict Cannabis drug consumption using features like Cocaine, Neuroticism Score, Extraversion Score, Openness Score, 
Agreeableness Score, Conscientiousness Score, Age Group, Country etc.).
                           
#### Bio-Signal Indicators for Smoking Behavior: 
Utilizing machine learning to analyze bio-signal data for indicators of smoking behavior, showcasing the potential of Machine Learning in health  informatics.

#### Flight Booking Price Prediction: 
Developed a machine learning model to predict a price for flight booking using features like Airline, Flight, Source city, Departure time, Stops, Arrival time, 
Destination city, Class, Duration, and Days left.

#### Bank Customer Churn Prediction with Deep Learning: 
Built the ANN model to predict whether a Customer will leave the bank or not using features like Credit Score, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, 
Number Of Products, Has CrCard, IsActiveMember, and Estimated Salary.
