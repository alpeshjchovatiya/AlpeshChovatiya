### üõ†Ô∏è Projects

[**Water Potability Prediction:**](https://github.com/alpeshjchovatiya/Water_Potability_Prediction)
Developed a machine learning model to predict water potability using key water quality parameters (e.g., pH, hardness, turbidity).
The model will classify water as potable or non-potable, offering a fast, reliable tool for assessing drinking water safety.

[**Drug Consumption Prediction**] 
Developed a machine learning model to predict Cannabis drug consumption using features like Cocaine, Neuroticism Score, Extraversion Score, Openness Score, 
Agreeableness Score, Conscientiousness Score, Age Group, Country etc.).
                           
[**Bio-Signal Indicators for Smoking Behavior**]
Utilizing machine learning to analyze bio-signal data for indicators of smoking behavior, showcasing the potential of Machine Learning in health  informatics.

[**Flight Booking Price Prediction**]
Developed a machine learning model to predict a price for flight booking using features like Airline, Flight, Source city, Departure time, Stops, Arrival time, 
Destination city, Class, Duration, and Days left.

[**Bank Customer Churn Prediction with Deep Learning**]
Built the ANN model to predict whether a Customer will leave the bank or not using features like Credit Score, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, 
Number Of Products, Has CrCard, IsActiveMember, and Estimated Salary.

[**IBM Data Science Capstone Project:**](https://github.com/alpeshjchovatiya/IBM-Data-Science-Capstone-Project/tree/main)
Developed a machine learning model to predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully or not.

[**Data Visualization with Power BI and Tableau:**](https://github.com/alpeshjchovatiya/PowerBI-Tableau---Auto-theft-from-GTA)
Developed a Power BI and Tableau to analyze Cars stolen from Greater Toronto Area between Years 2013 to 2023.
